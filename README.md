# [Lottery Simulation](https://github.com/fatmazaman/Lottery-Simulation)


Implemented the code that will generate 6 lottery numbers between 1 and 49 (inclusive), Also implemented the code that will read in 6 numbers that you will type into the console yourself. Then the numbers you input will be compared against the randomly generated lottery numbers and it will output which numbers match (if any).
Here’s the catch, you will need to make sure there are no duplicate numbers (either when being randomly generated or inputted in the console). It’s just like a real lottery after-all!


_implementation_

__Lottery Generator :__ Generate 6 random numbers between 1 to 49.
 `random.nextInt((max-min)+1)min;`

__Lottery Picker :__ list your lottery number to match with lottery numbers

__Play Lottery :__ It will compare both randomly generated lottery numbers and user numbers and tell us we are lucky enough to get the lottery or not!
